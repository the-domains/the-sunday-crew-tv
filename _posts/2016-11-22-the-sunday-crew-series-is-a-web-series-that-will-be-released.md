# Synopsis

### The Sunday Crew Series is a web series that will be released during the fall of 2016\.

### The Crew consists of Hoover, Bom Bom, Shorty, Cream and Cheese. The other central characters we meet are Larsen, Tsar, his daughter Alexandra, and his right hand Martin.

### The protagonist, Hoover, struggles to rid himself off of Tsar's -- one of the rulers of the European underground - control on him. After Hoover took on the task of returning a painting, one conflict occurs after the other: Cheese's intimate relationship to Tsar's daughter, the crew and Tsar's different objectives, Hoover's mental health, and most importantly to return a painting they don't know where is. Why is the painting so important to Tsar? What has Tsar got on Hoover and the Crew? What's in the shadow of Alexandra and Cheese's relationship and how does Alexandra's daddy issues complicate her life? Will the Crew manage to stay loyal to each other when their lives are at stake?

### The Series will be set and filmed in Kristiansand, using a local director, promoter, producer, actors, musicians, studios, screenwriter, photographer(s) and venues. Not only do we aim to promote Kristiansand's potential as a small town where we make things happen, but also as a channel to promote the landscape, cultural climate, architecture and musicians.

### We aim to give a being to something we didn't think could exist.
